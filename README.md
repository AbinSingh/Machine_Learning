# Machine Learning / Variable selection method

Purpose:
Purpose of this project is to build the module with methods/functions which can be used in statsmodel to select the variable and build the final model.
Reason:
As variabe selection methods are not available in the statsmodel package, time consuming is more in model building. So i decided to create a module which gives stepwise, forward and bacward elimination method.
