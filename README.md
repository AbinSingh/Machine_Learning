# Machine Learning / Variable selection method

Purpose:
Purpose of this project is to create a module with methods/functions which can be used in statsmodel to select the variable in model building process.
Reason:
As variabe selection methods are not available in the statsmodel package, time consuming is more in model building stage. So i decided to create a module which gives stepwise, forward and bacward elimination method.
